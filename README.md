This respository houses the **databases and the decision-making framework** that I worked on during my PhD for safe and resilient design of future space systems. 

Future space systems, like lunar & martian habitats will be exposed to several hazards - both foreseen and unforeseen. Traditional safety processes target foreseen hazards. 
However, as our systems, get more complex and further away from us, they're going to have more unforeseen then foreseen hazards - with the added difficulty of us not being able to respond to them in time. 

Therefore, we developed a metric that can help engineers strategically select safety controls and enhance systems resileience for foreseen and unforeseen hazards. 

In this respository, I am including the decision-making framework for the metric and the database we developed. Here is a bried description of all files: 

1. mobility_texture_maps.py [Visualizes mobility maps that we defined]
2. Resilience Potential Framework.xlsx [Presents the key elements of the resilienece potential metric]
3. Safety Control Library & Potential Assessments.xlsx [This includes our initial library of safety controls considered as part of the thesis, preliminary, adn detailed assessments].

I am currently working on turning this work into publications. 
But there are several avenues of future work that I am co-currently pursuing under AeroWorks LLC. This work will be used to build an AI-powered safety decision-making tool.
